Welcome to my personal website! I loved the Design of the homepage from *Ruud van Asseldonk* [1] and his philosophy on creating simple yet beautiful pages. In my journey to understand the **behind**, i recreated large parts myself, cut even larger parts out and let the core of his design remain.

I hope that i stay consistent enough to order my thoughts and projects to present them in a way that poeple would like to read them. 

Programming is a journey and when i have thoughts or opinions that you disagree with, i would love to hear about it. Sometimes one dont get the full picture and moments like those are great to reconsider. Please write me a [mail](contact), i would love to hear if you agree or disagree with my views, hopefully i learn something new.
