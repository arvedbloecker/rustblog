# Welcome to my blog

I discovered the personal page of Ruud van Asseldonk [1] and was drawn to his clean design. I always wanted something more than just a plain landing page, and the idea of organizing my thoughts and projects seemed appealing. Ruud created his page in 2015, and while the programming landscape has evolved significantly since then, I didn't want to simply copy his open-sourced design. Instead, I wanted to understand how it works and learn how to structure a page as beautiful as his. So I took the basic design concept and built the rest from scratch.

What I appreciate most is the elegance of his site despite using only the most fundamental elements of HTML and CSS. As part of my journey to better understand Rust, I plan to implement future features of this page in that programming language. I also used Zola to generate this site, since it is also written in Rust.

And so it was born, my first page where I can properly present my projects.

## What's Next?

I've been thinking about modifying the page with WebAssembly, as the whole concept sounds intriguing, but I'm not entirely sure how feasible this approach is. How much JavaScript can realistically be replaced by WebAssembly, and how will this technology develop in the future? Regardless, there's still plenty to accomplish before I run out of ideas:

- Write more posts
- Improve the design
  - Better alignment
  - Better structure for mobile devices
